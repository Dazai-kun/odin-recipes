    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This recipe was created by trying to copy a steak pie made at the 'Butt and Ben' Scottish Bakery in Pickering, Ontario. 
        My husband says it's better! You could also add 2 calf kidneys (well washed and de-veined and cut into bite sized pieces) to make Steak and Kidney Pie!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>

            1 pound cubed beef stew meat
            </li>
        <li>

            1 large onion, chopped
            </li>
        <li>

            1 (1 ounce) package dry mushroom gravy mix
            </li>
        <li>

            1 cup water
            </li>
        <li>

            1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
            </li>
        <li>

            1 pinch salt and pepper to taste
            </li>
        <li>

            1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
            </li>

        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>

            1 tablespoon water
            </li>

            
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef stew meat, and cook until browned on the outside. Add the onion; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mushroom gravy mix and 1 cup of water. Season with Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Turn heat to low, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Transfer the beef mixture to a casserole dish. Roll out the puff pastry to cover the top of the casserole dish. Press edges onto the rim of the dish to seal. Whisk together the egg and 1 tablespoon of water in a small cup using a fork. Brush over the top of the pastry. </li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the pastry is puffed and golden brown. </li>
    </ol>
